# Local Environment Setup

## Python
You will need python setup on your local environment. The version must be great than Python version 3.6. 

If you're running a mac, you already have this install. If you're running windows you can either download Pythong to your machine (https://www.python.org/downloads/) or you can download Anaconda to better manage your python version (https://www.anaconda.com/download - skip the registration step).

It's assumed that you're familiar with setting up Python on your local environment. 

### Python Virtual Environments

It's recommended that you setup a python virtual environment to install the below python package(s).

Anaconda provides a nice way to craete a virtual env.
